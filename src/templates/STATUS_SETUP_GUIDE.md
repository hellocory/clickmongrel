# ClickUp Status Configuration Guide

## IMPORTANT: Manual Status Setup Required

ClickUp's API doesn't allow creating custom statuses programmatically. You need to configure them manually in the ClickUp UI for proper task and commit tracking.

## üìã Tasks List Status Configuration

Navigate to your **Tasks** list in ClickUp and configure these statuses:

### Not Started (Gray)
- **TO DO** - Tasks not yet started
- **FUTURE** - Tasks planned for later

### Active (Blue/Yellow)
- **IN PROGRESS** - Currently being worked on
- **FIXING** - Addressing issues or bugs

### Done (Green)
- **COMPLETED** - Task finished successfully

**Setup Steps:**
1. Open your Tasks list in ClickUp
2. Click the list options (3 dots) ‚Üí Edit statuses
3. Select "Use custom statuses"
4. Add the statuses above with their respective colors
5. Save the configuration

## üîÑ Commits List Status Configuration

Navigate to your **Commits** list in ClickUp and configure these statuses:

### Development Phase
- **development update** (Gray) - Regular development commits
- **development push** (Blue) - Pushed to remote branch
- **upstream merge** (Purple) - Merged from upstream
- **merged** (Green) - Merged to main branch

### Production Phase
- **production/testing** (Yellow) - In testing phase
- **production/staging** (Orange) - Deployed to staging
- **production/final** (Green) - Deployed to production

**Setup Steps:**
1. Open your Commits list in ClickUp
2. Click the list options (3 dots) ‚Üí Edit statuses
3. Select "Use custom statuses"
4. Add all the statuses above
5. Save the configuration

## üéØ Why These Statuses Matter

### For Tasks:
- **TO DO** ‚Üí Maps from `pending` in TodoWrite
- **IN PROGRESS** ‚Üí Maps from `in_progress` in TodoWrite
- **COMPLETED** ‚Üí Maps from `completed` in TodoWrite
- **FUTURE** ‚Üí For backlog items
- **FIXING** ‚Üí For bug fixes and issues

### For Commits:
The commit lifecycle tracking allows you to see the full journey of your code:
1. **development update** - Initial commit
2. **development push** - Shared with team
3. **upstream merge** - Integrated changes
4. **merged** - In main branch
5. **production/testing** - Being tested
6. **production/staging** - In staging environment
7. **production/final** - Live in production

## ‚úÖ Verification

After setting up statuses, run:
```bash
node dist/cli.js status
```

This will show you the current configuration and verify everything is set up correctly.

## üîß Troubleshooting

If status mapping isn't working:
1. Check that status names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure you selected "Use custom statuses" not "Inherit from Space"
3. Try refreshing the configuration:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js quick-setup --workspace "Your Workspace"
   ```

## üìù Notes

- Status names must match exactly for proper syncing
- Colors help with visual organization but aren't required for functionality
- The system will map similar status names if exact matches aren't found
- You can add additional statuses as needed for your workflow
